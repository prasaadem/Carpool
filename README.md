To run the website, create a new database and the .sql files from the Dataset folder into your server and run it. This will create the tables and all the tables with information.
Now copy all the files from the Source Code folder onto the server.
Open the db.php file and make changes to the below function accordingly.
$con = mysqli_connect ("localhost","id18655_prasaadem","Cnsape@2923","id18655_r egister");
You can access the webpage by calling index.php file, if the server is up and running.
I hosted this website on a different third party server to be accessible at all times. The website can be accessed at below address:
